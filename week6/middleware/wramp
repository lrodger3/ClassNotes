## WARMUP(middleware) - you will have an in-class challenge in lecture this afternoon!

Create a simple express application scaffold

Make sure to create your package.json, .gitignore, and your server.js

install express through npm

write a GET route handler for / that sends down the following text : 
'Grumpy Wizards make toxic brew for the Evil Queen and Jack'

Also, run your server and access it through the browser or PostMan to make sure it works!
