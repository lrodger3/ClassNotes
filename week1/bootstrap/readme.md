# Bootstrap

> One of the most popular CSS frameworks

## What is it?

- Essentially, Bootstrap is just a bunch of class selectors / styles in a CSS file
- Focused on responsive / mobile-first development (especially the grid)

Bootstrap comes with a lot of components
- Normalization (standardizing browser idiosyncracies)
- Typography (default font is now a sans-serif)
- Layout (Grid system!)
- Forms
- Buttons
- and much much more!
