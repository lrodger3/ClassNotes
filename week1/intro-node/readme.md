# NodeJS
> Runtime environment for Javascript

## Runtime Environment
  - A place for javascript to run
  - Node is one, the browser is the other big environment
  - Because Node is a newer, more portable runtime environment, we can put Javascript in all sorts of places it doesn't belong
  
## Differences between Node and Browser

- browser : `window`, node : `global`
- browser : No hardware/file system access, node : hardware/networking/file system, etc
- Node has a lot of IoT potential

DOM - Document Object Model - rendered browser content
`node script.js` - run a file with node
