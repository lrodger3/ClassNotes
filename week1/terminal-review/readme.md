# Terminal Review


- `cd <directory>` - change directory you are navigated to
  - `cd ..` - take you back up a directory

- `ls` - lists files and directories inside of the directory you are navigated to
  - `-a` - lists hidden files/folders
  - `-l` - lists things vertically
  
- `pwd` - print working directory - this will return the absolute file path to where you are navigated to

-`cp <whatToCopy> <whereToCopy>` - copy
  - `-r` - recursive - copy the directory and any/all things inside of it
  
-`mv <whatToMove> <whereToMove>` - move - instead of copying, it _moves_ the file/directory.  You don't even need the `-r`!

-`rm <whatToRemove>` - remove
Dont : `sudo rm -rf *`

-`rmdir` - remove directory

-`sudo` - SuperUser Do - root.  Gives you root access to run a command, allowing you to effect files you wouldn't normally be able to

-`find` - Much, much faster than the Windows counterpart - used for finding files in your system

-`cat` - catalog

-`--help` - flag that can be applied to _most_ commands to see an explanation / list of flags

-`mkdir` - make a directory
-`touch` - make a file

-`vi` - opens up a vi editor
  - `:wq` - write/quit from vi
  
-`chmod 777 <file/folder>` - changes read/write/execute permissions for a file
