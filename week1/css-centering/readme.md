# Centering!


## Horizontal
> The interwebs was originally designed for sharing text and text documents - horizontal centering is easy

for `block` elements : 
  - width under 100%
  - margin left/right auto

for `inline` or `inline-block` elements :
  - `text-align` : center on a __PARENT__ element

## Vertical
> Vertical centering is something that isn't often needed in a text document so it's more difficult than horizontal

- `line-height` / `vertical-align`
  - content with a height / line-height that match
  - vertical-align helps decide _where_ on the line it should render text
