## How to get started
> Gulp is one of the rare node modules that needs to be installed _globally_ and _locally_

1. ONE-TIME :  Install Gulp globally
  - `sudo npm install -g gulp`
  
2. Install Gulp locally
  - `npm install gulp --save-dev`
  - `--save-dev` flag saves `gulp` as a _dev dependency_
    - This means it's not necessary for your application to run
    
3. Create a `Gulpfile.js`

4. Install any Gulp plugins as dev dependencies
  - `gulp-concat`
  - `gulp-uglify`
  - `gulp-clean-css`
  - `gulp-imagemin`
