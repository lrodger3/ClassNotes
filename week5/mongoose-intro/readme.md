# Mongoose

> Mongoose is a node module that we will be using to interact with our mongoDB databases in Node

        --Request--->         ----- request -->
Client /             \ Server/                 \ MongoDB 


## Why Mongoose vs the native MongoDB drivers?

- Mongoose provides many extra features and layers that you don't get with vanilla mongoDB

- Mongoose brings order and structure to an otherwise wild west database
  - Schema and validation for our data
  - "Relationships"
  - Changes how many of the methods work and provides a nicer API
